# Testing Notes

I'm using [sepia](https://github.com/linkedin/sepia) to cache HTTP responses in the tests. To take advantage of this, it's easiest to just set the `VCR_MODE` environmental variable to "cache". HTTP requests will fire the first time, but cached files will be used thereafter. See Sepia's documentation for more details & options.
