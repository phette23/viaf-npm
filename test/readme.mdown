# Testing Notes

I'm new to unit testing & have never tested a module that relies so heavily on an HTTP API. While I know this should be done through mocking HTTP requests & responses, that's a lot to research so for now I'm doing actual calls against the VIAF API in the tests. They'll be slow, & maybe brittle, but that's better than nothing.
